        "Overall, this assignment went well because I was able to successfully implement the required features and understand how each part of the code worked together. I felt more comfortable navigating Google Colab and organizing my notebook with both code and text cells. Testing the code step-by-step helped me identify errors quickly and better understand the logic behind the implementation.\n",

        "One challenge I encountered was debugging errors when the code did not run as expected. At times, small syntax mistakes or incorrect variable usage caused issues that took time to identify. Additionally, understanding certain concepts initially required reviewing notes and examples. However, working through these challenges helped strengthen my problem-solving skills and improved my confidence in using Python and Colab."
